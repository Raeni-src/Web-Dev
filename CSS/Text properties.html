        <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda 
            which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, 
            which is used for control of buoyancy.

        <p>
            Cuttlefish eat small <a href="nowhere">molluscs</a>, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators include 
            dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, humans, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a cuttlefish 
            is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.
            [4] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]

        <h2>Range and Habitat</h2>

        <p>
            The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are mostly 
            shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[11] They have an unusual 
            biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean, 
            as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas.

        <h3>Visual System</h3>
        <p>
            Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the cephalopod 
            eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[15] Superficial similarities between cephalopod and 
            vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly curving W-shape.
